Recently, I was reading a paper[^footnote] which I found new for myself. Therefore, I decided to understand the problem described in it and share it with you. In this blog post, we will see what is **binary function similarity** problem, why it is important and we will learn more about the existing approaches to solve this problem.

## Binary Function Similarity
Binary function similarity is the problem of **taking as input the binary representation of a pair of functions, and producing as output a numeric value that captures the “similarity” between them**.
