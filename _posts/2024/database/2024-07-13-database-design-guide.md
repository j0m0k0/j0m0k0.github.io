As a guy who works in the computer science area, there will be a lot of times that you come up with a small idea for a program and you want to do it by yourself. One of the important parts of each computer software is its data. How do you design this data system? Do we really need a system or database for storing data? In this post, I will introduce a step-by-step approach that helps you in designing a database for your software.

> This guide is for those who want to use relational databases for their application, if you want to use a NoSQL database, most of them concepts are useful to do, but this article is not written for this purpose.

## 0. Understanding Data Models

A **data model** is an abstract model that organizes data elements and standardizes how they relate to one another and to properties of the real world entities. Among the most important models are the relational model, the document model, and the entity-relationship model. These models are essential because they help us structure our data in a way that makes it both efficient and meaningful for specific applications.

## 1. Do You Need a Database?

Deciding whether you need a database depends on the scale and purpose of your application. For small, single-user applications with non-critical data, simple file storage or even manual record-keeping might be sufficient. However, for applications that require handling complex queries, multiple users, data integrity, and security, a database is essential. In other words, there are some questions that you can ask yourself and if their answer is YES, it means you need to use a database:
- Do you need to run complex queries? (yes/no)
- Does your data will change frequently? (yes/no)
- Does you data size will increase over time? (yes/no)

## 2. Design Your Entity-Relationship Diagram

An **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram** is a type of structural diagram for use in database design. It provides a graphical representation of the entities, the relationships between them, and their attributes. Consider an online shopping platform as an example. You can think of it in different ways. You can have a `top-down strategy` or a `bottom-up strategy` or other strategies. So, you can think of a system in different ways and none of them are wrong. You should select the one that you think is more correct. Let's think of the online shopping platform using a top-down strategy.

- **Entities**: We will have **customers** that can **order** different **products** which is provided by **vendors**.
- **Relationships**: Customers **place** Orders; Orders **contain** Products. Product **may include** in orders; and Vendors **provide** the products.

Start by identifying the entities and their relationships. Then, determine the attributes of each entity.

## 3. Map It to Relational Model

To translate your ER diagram into a **relational model**, you convert entities into tables, relationships into foreign keys, and attributes into columns within these tables. Using our online shopping example:
- **Customer Table**: CustomerID, Name, Address.
- **Product Table**: ProductID, Name, Price.
- **Order Table**: OrderID, CustomerID (foreign key), OrderDate.

## 4. Implementation

Once you have your relational model, the next step is to implement it in a database management system (DBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite. This involves creating the tables according to the relational schema and then writing SQL queries to interact with the data.

## 5. Maintenance and Improvement

To improve the database's efficiency and reduce data redundancy, apply **normalization** techniques. Normalization involves decomposing a table into less redundant (and more independent) tables but still containing the same information. It helps in maintaining data integrity and optimizing query performance.

By following these steps, you can design a robust database system tailored to your softwareâ€™s specific needs.
